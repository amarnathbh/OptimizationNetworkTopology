Optimizing The Cost For 3X3 Network Topology and Cube Topology



*Minimizing the optimal cost of the network under normal operating
condition and considering restoration design model for failure of any
node in 3x3 and cube topology.

*Performance and effects of optimization for the following conditions:
link failures, node failures, increase or decrease in the link capacity were
also implemented.
